        <h4>Global Warming is a term almost everyone is familiar with. But, its meaning is still not clear to most of us. So, Global warming refers to the gradual rise in the overall temperature of the atmosphere of the Earth. There are various activities taking place which have been increasing the temperature gradually. Global warming is melting our ice glaciers rapidly. This is extremely harmful to the earth as well as humans. It is quite challenging to control global warming; however, it is not unmanageable. The first step in solving any problem is identifying the cause of the problem. Therefore, we need to first understand the causes of global warming that will help us proceed further in solving it. In this article on Global Warming, we will see the causes and solutions of Global Warming. Click on the buttons below to learn about each topic.</h4>

                            Global warming has become a grave problem which needs undivided attention. It is not happening because of a single cause but several causes. These causes are both natural as well as manmade. The natural causes include the release of greenhouses gases which are not able to escape from earth, causing the temperature to increase.
                            Further, volcanic eruptions are also responsible for global warming. That is to say, these eruptions release tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. Similarly, methane is also one big issue responsible for global warming.
                            After that, the excessive use of automobiles and fossil fuels results in increased levels of carbon dioxide. In addition, activities like mining and cattle rearing are very harmful to the environment. One of the most common issues that are taking place rapidly is deforestation.
                            So, when one of the biggest sources of absorption of carbon dioxide will only disappear, there will be nothing left to regulate the gas. Thus, it will result in global warming. Steps must be taken immediately to stop global warming and make the earth better again.

                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p> We must all know by now that the temperature of earth has gotten warmer by one degree Celsius. Although it looks small in number now but the consequences it has are massive. It is so because the amount of energy we need to augment this temperature even by one degree Celsius is huge. This extra energy is equivalent to force-feeding our climate system. We are experiencing hotter and hotter days due to global warming only. Each year we are breaking the record for experience the hottest day, month or year. The worrying degree has gone as far as 54 degrees Celsius. Moreover, the frequent and intense extreme weather events we are facing are also due to that only. You see forest fires, droughts, floods, and more natural disasters becoming more and more common. For instance, the Amazon Rainforest fire being the latest one. The melting of ice caps and glaciers is also a result of global warming only. All this melted ice just creates a rise in the water volume of the oceans. The sea levels are increasing due to this. Moreover, the warmer the temperature gets, the more the mass of the water expands. It poses a great threat to the low-lying islands and coastal cities.Furthermore, our oceans are becoming warmer and acidifying. As these water bodies absorb most of the excess heat as well as Carbon Dioxide they have become more acidic. This, in turn, also results in coral bleaching. In addition, it also drives stronger storms. This rising acidity poses a great threat to aquatic life and disrupts their food chain. Thus, we need to soon get together to eliminate this problem to help our earth heal.</p>

                            <u> Some solutions to Global Warming include:</u>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Change a light</b> <br />
                            Replacing one regular light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb will save 150 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Drive less</b> <br />
                            Walk, bike, carpool or take mass transit more often. You'll save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile you don't drive!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Recycle more</b> <br />
                            You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Check your tires</b> <br />
                            Keeping your tires inflated properly can improve your gas mileage by more than 3 percent. Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Use less hot water</b> <br />
                            It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Avoid products with a lot of packaging</b> <br />
                            You can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Adjust your thermostat</b> <br />
                            Moving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Plant a tree</b> <br />
                            A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Turn off electronic devices</b> <br />
                            Simply turning off your television, DVD player, stereo, and computer, when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
